TI BQ40Z50 Fuel-Gauge Power Supply bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "ti,bq40z50"
- reg: i2c address of the device

Optional properties:
- ti,fg-soc-low-thr: low battery soc threshold, valid range: 1 ~ 10
- ti,fg-soc-recharge-thr: recharge soc threshold, valid range: 90 ~ 99
- ti,fg-soc-static-remap: if defined, soc will be remapped as below
  capacity reports 100 for soc range between ti,fg-soc-recharge-thr ~ 100
  capacity reports 1 for range between 1 ~ ti,fg-soc-low-thr
  capacity reports linear mapping from ti,fg-soc-low-thr+1 ~ ti,fg-soc-recharge-thr-1 to 2 ~ 99

Example:

bq40z50: bq40z50@b {
	compatible = "ti,bq40z50";
	reg = <0xb>;
	ti,fg-soc-low-thr = <3>;
	ti,fg-soc-recharge-thr = <95>;
	ti,fg-soc-static-remap;
};
