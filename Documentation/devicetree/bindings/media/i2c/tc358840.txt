* Toshiba TC358840 HDMI-RX to MIPI CSI2-TX Bridge

The Toshiba TC358840 HDMI-RX to MIPI CSI2-TX (H2C) is a bridge that converts
a HDMI stream to MIPI CSI-2 TX. It is programmable through I2C.

Required Properties:

- compatible: value should be "toshiba,tc358743"
- clocks, clock-names: should contain a phandle link to the reference clock
		       source, the clock input is named "refclk".

Optional Properties:

- reset-gpios: gpio phandle GPIO connected to the reset pin
- interrupts, interrupt-parent: GPIO connected to the interrupt pin
- data-lanes: should be <1 2 3 4> for four-lane operation,
	      or <1 2> for two-lane operation
- clock-lanes: should be <0>
- clock-noncontinuous: Presence of this boolean property decides whether the
		       MIPI CSI-2 clock is continuous or non-continuous.
- link-frequencies: List of allowed link frequencies in Hz. Each frequency is
		    expressed as a 64-bit big-endian integer. The frequency
		    is half of the bps per lane due to DDR transmission.

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	tc358840xbg@0f {
		compatible = "toshiba,tc358840xbg";
		reg = <0x0f>;
		interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
		interrupts = <92 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		/* GPIO */
		reset-gpios = <&tlmm 91 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		refclk_hz = <48000000>; /* 40 - 50 MHz */

		clock-names = "tc358840xbg_clk";
		clocks = <&clock_rpmh AUDIO_AP_CLK2>;

		pinctrl-names = "active", "sleep";
		pinctrl-0 = <&tc358840xbg_irq_active &tc358840xbg_reset_active>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&tc358840xbg_irq_sleep &tc358840xbg_reset_sleep>;
		device-config = "config_C";
	};
